h1 Asset ID - Asset stamping and uploading to S3 for Rails

h2 About

Uploads static assets to Amazon S3 with unique identifiers encoded into the path of the asset. 

Only works with Rails 3.x because Rails 3 makes doing this sort of thing a lot easier and
that is all I needed it for.

* Assets served from a cookie-less domain
* Unique identifier is not encoded into a query parameter (so it is cacheable by proxy servers)
* All assets have far-future expires headers for caching
* Assets have the Cache-Control: public header for caching
* CSS and javascript is GZipped

h2 Usage

<code>config/environments/production.rb</code>

<pre><code>config.action_controller.asset_host = Proc.new do |source|
 'http://my_bucket.s3.amazonaws.com'
end
config.action_controller.asset_path = Proc.new do |source|
 AssetID::S3.fingerprint(source)
end
</code></pre>

<code>lib/tasks/asset_id_tasks.rake</code>

<pre><code>namespace :asset do
  namespace :id do
    
    desc "uploads the current assets to s3 with fingerprints"
    task :upload do
      AWS::S3::DEFAULT_HOST.replace "s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com"
      AssetID::Base.asset_paths += ['favicon.png']
      AssetID::S3.upload
    end
